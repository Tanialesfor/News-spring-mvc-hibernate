They complete the missing rung in the logical ladder that allows you to get GoF patterns from OOP principles. GRASP patterns are rather than design patterns (like GoF's), but the fundamental principles of the distribution of responsibility between classes. As practice shows, they are not very popular, but the analysis of designed classes using the full set of GRASP patterns is a necessary condition for writing good code.
Low Coupling is the distribution of responsibility between classes with minimal connectivity between them.
The High Cohesion principle - classes should contain related business logic.
Low Coupling and High Cohesion are two interconnected patterns that only make sense to consider together. Their essence can be combined as follows: the system must also consist of loosely coupled classes that contain related business logic. Compliance with these principles allows you to conveniently use the newly created classes without losing understanding of their area of ​​responsibility.
