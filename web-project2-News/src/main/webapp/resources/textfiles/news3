The next version of standard Java will incubate scoped values, an API that enables sharing immutable data within and across large numbers 
of threads. Java 20, or Java Development Kit (JDK) 20, the next planned version of standard Java, has reached the release candidate stage, 
having completed rampdown phases. The six features officially marked for the release are either in an incubation or in a preview stage. 
These include scoped values, record patterns, pattern matching for switch statements and expressions, a foreign function and memory API, 
virtual threads, and structured concurrency. Java 20 moved to the release candidate phase on February 9, according to a bulletin from 
Oracle's Mark Reinhold, chief architect of the Java Platform Group. A second release candidate is due February 23. The release reached 
an initial rampdown phase on December 8 and a subsequent rampdown phase on January 19, with developers looking to fix bugs and possibly 
add late enhancements, with approvals required. The JDK is due for general availability on March 21, 2023, as part of Oracleâ€™s six-month 
 cadence for standard Java editions. JDK 20 would follow the September 20 release of JDK 19. Early-access builds of JDK 20 can be found at jdk.java.net.
